# Password-Generator
Week 5 Bootcamp Challenge

Password Generator application that can be used to assign random passwords to employees based on a series of criteria.

When the generate a password button is clicked, the application needs to ask to user for the preferred password length, which has to be between 8 and 128 (inclusive).

Once the password length input has been received, the user gets to choose if they would like their password to include special characters from 4 arrays (lspecial, numeric, lowercase or uppercase).

At least one of those must be selected. 

After validating that at least one character type was selected, the application will then select randomly from the input.

Once the random character was generated, the password can be created by filling in the rest with random letters.

!!!At the moment, the application is not fully finished. The password length and the user selection sections are functional, but the generate password section is not working and I can't figure out what I am doing wrong. It will most probably be a resubmission, but did not want to leave it un-submitted, as I am invested in figuring it out and would like to get some feedback on it.
